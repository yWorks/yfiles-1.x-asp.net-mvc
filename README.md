## yFiles for HTML 1.x with ASP.Net MVC backend

Slightly outdated repository showing how to integrate yFiles for HTML 1.x in an ASP.net MVC application.
Conceptually the same setup will work with yFiles for HTML 2.x, but of course the (yFiles specific JavaScript) sources need to be updated to the new API.

See the [overview article](docs/Overview.md) for details on how the solution was set up and references.
