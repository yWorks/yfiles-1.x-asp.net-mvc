## yFiles for HTML 1.x with ASP.Net MVC backend

Slightly outdated repository showing how to integrate yFiles for HTML 1.x in an ASP.net MVC application.
There is an [updated repo](https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-asp.net-mvc) for yFiles for HTML 2.x.

See the [overview article](docs/Overview.md) for details on how the solution was set up with yFiles for HTML 1.x.
